# A comparative study of different approaches to HAR using sensor data

Because of the various drawbacks of Machine learning models like feature engineering and all, we have a direct jump towards deep learninng models. The data for Human Activity Recognition(HAR) is going to be a time series data, thus models used are as follows-

1. LSTM (specialized RNN architecture)
2. CNN-GRU (a hybrid deep learning model)
3. Soft Attention mechanism (a bassic attention model)

Here, two datasets have been used to do comparision between them - 
1. UCI-HAR

2. WISDM dataset (available here - https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)
